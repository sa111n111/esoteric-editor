# GUI module

Currently maintained by @razetime

## Implementation
- **Language:** The current language is Tcl. First a normal Tcl/Tk GUI will be made. Snap!(a scratch like language) is also an option, but unlikely.
- **Interpreter Binary:** https://platform.activestate.com/razetime/Tcl-8.6.11.1-Windows/distributions , You will need to login to activestate to download the requisite binary.

## Style
Preferably close to vscode's style.
- File tree
- icon bar
- menu bar
- editing view
